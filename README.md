free music is nice  

This is a python based program that gives you the experience of Spotify without ads. 
It skips them by asking Spotify what song is playing, and if it's an ad, reloading 
Spotify. As Spotify does not remember if it was playing an ad between restarts of 
the desktop application, it effectively skips the ad.

## Some details regarding software versioning and such
I'm using python 3.9 to run this as am on the most up to date version of OSX as of 
whatever the date of the last push to this repository was.  

I'm not sure if this method will work on unix-like/windows (although I can guarantee 
that the current code won't work unless you have osascript or something similar).
